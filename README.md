# DRstore

Our website is an e-Commerce platform, that caters to customers buying and selling goods on the platform. There are a wide variety of items customers can buy or sell on the platform, including food & beverages, jewellery, furniture, apparel and etcetera. Our game on that platform is to allow customers a chance to win discount vouchers for themselves to use when purchasing items by playing the game. 


 
## Design Process
 
Insights:
This website is for users who want to buy and types of items and goods online, especially during this covid pandemic where they can rarely leave the house to shop for items. This website can help those who are too lazy or busy to leave the house, and purchase what they want or need online in an instant efficiently and without hassle. This website is also for users who have suppliers or want to sell their own brand of goods, so they can use our platform to become a seller internationally. This website can help them become a seller not just in their own country, but across the globel as the platform reaches out to everyone on the internet. It is also a fast and efficient way for them to sell their items as they just have to post it on the platform and wait for interested buyers.

User Stories:
- As a buyer, I want to be able to see the price of the item, so I know how much it is worth
- As a buyer, I want to be able to see how the item looks like, so I know what I am purchasing
- As a buyer, I want to be able to have discounts, so that I can save more money in my spending
- As a seller, I want to be able to change the price of the item, so I can set it to what I want

This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. 
These files should themselves either be included as a pdf file in the project itself (in an separate directory)
Include the Adobe XD wireframe as a folder. You can include the XD share url.

## Technologies Used

In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.

- [JQuery](https://jquery.com)
    - The project uses **JQuery** to simplify DOM manipulation.


## Testing

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.
